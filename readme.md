# Rats Library

The Rats Library is a collection of RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware samples. Each sample includes a brief summary.

The idea is that it should be a library of only the most iconic and complex rats and not just any junk that one could find in OpenSC. The rats uploaded are from the official web pages and clean versions or at least that was the idea when I started the project.

This project is for Indetectables.net


## Contributing

The samples must be compressed with rar and must include a file called "info.txt" where the basic info must be placed.

This is an example of such a file:
```
Developer: stm
Compiler: Delphi
Compatibility: XP/?
Date Released: 2005-07-17
Last Version Released: 1.3 beta 2
Web: censorednet.org
```

The idea was to add also some reports analyzing those samples but due to lack of time I could not add any yet. If someone wants to collaborate adding them it would be an excellent idea.
